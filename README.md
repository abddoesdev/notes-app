### Practice makes perfect ;)
The goal of this project was to practice React, Redux and React-Router to build complete client side application. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes
1. Id should be same for the snapshot of firebase and document. If different, it is very tricky and memory heavy.
2. I could make a feature that runs database functions after the application closes. I couldn't be able to achieve that.

**You can try and do these.** You know how _everything works_
